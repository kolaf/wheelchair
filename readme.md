# Permobil X850 interface

Software and PCB layout for interfacing with Permobil X850. The PCB is designed to connect as a shield to an Arduino UNO (quite new revision with separate SDA and SCL pins).

Required hardware for the PCB:
- 2 x MCP4725 breakout board (e.g. https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12918?_ga=2.262677324.1542276605.1534867328-307128903.1534867328)
- LM358P OpAmp
- 2 x 89361-708LF socket (8 - socket)

Note: Both software and hardware will be slightly redesigned in the future
